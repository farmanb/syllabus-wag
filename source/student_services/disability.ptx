  <title>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</title>
  <p>
    Students needing testing or classroom accommodations based on a disability must be registered with the Louisiana Tech University Office of Testing &amp; Disability Services. Students are encouraged to discuss those needs with the instructor as soon as possible. If you do not have a current accommodation memo, visit the <url href="https://www.latech.edu/student-life/student-support-and-resources/disability-services/">Office of Testing &amp; Disability Services</url> for assistance.
