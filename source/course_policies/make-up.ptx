  <title>Make-up Policy</title>
  <p>
    In the event of one missed exam due to absence, the Final Exam can be used to replace the missing exam.
    Further missed exams will result in a grade of zero.
    If a University sponsored activity requires you to miss an exam, you must complete the exam in advance.
  </p>

  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   Make-up opportunities will only be granted in cases of documented emergencies or university-approved absences (e.g., illness, family emergencies, or official university activities). -->
  <!--     Except in extraordinary circumstances, students must notify the instructor before the missed deadline or class. -->
  <!--     Students who need to make up work due to a University-related activity requiring an absence from class must arrange for work to be completed <alert>before</alert> leaving.  -->
