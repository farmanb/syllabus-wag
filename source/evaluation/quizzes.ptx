    Quizzes will be administered periodically to assess understanding of key concepts and ensure students are keeping up with the material.
    These will be short, focused assessments designed to reinforce learning and identify areas for improvement.
    They are an opportunity to practice applying course concepts and receive feedback on your progress.
