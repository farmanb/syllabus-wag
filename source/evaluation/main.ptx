  <subsection xml:id="homework" component="homework">
    <title>Homework</title>
    <p>
      Homework assignments are a critical component of the course.
      They are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lectures and provide hands-on experience.
      Assignments will include a mix of logical proofs, programming tasks, and conceptual exercises.
      Solutions must be submitted on time and will be graded for clarity and correctness.
      Collaboration is encouraged, but each student must submit their own work.
    </p>

    <p component="graduate">
      In addition to the core problems assigned to all students, graduate students will tackle advanced exercises that require a deeper understanding of the material and the ability to explore alternative approaches.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Homework will be assigned regularly.
      The problems are chosen to highlight the core concepts from the material.
      Mastery of these homework sets serves as a good indicator for performance on assessments.
      As such, you should ensure that you fully understand the material on these homework sets; that is, upon completion of the homework set, you should be capable of completing similar problems without the aid of the text, a computer, or any other tools not available during an exam.

    <title>Quizzes</title>
    <p>
      Quizzes will be administered periodically to assess understanding of key concepts and ensure students are keeping up with the material.
      These will be short, focused assessments designed to reinforce learning and identify areas for improvement.
      They are an opportunity to practice applying course concepts and receive feedback on your progress.
