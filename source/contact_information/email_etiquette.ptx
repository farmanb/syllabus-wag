    <p>Dear <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Farman,</p>

    <p>
      I am having trouble with this week's homework.
      I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved.
      Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?
    </p>

    <p>Thank you,</p>
    
    <p>Jane Doe</p>
