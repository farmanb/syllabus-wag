# Syllabus Template
This is a [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/documentation.html) syllabus template for courses that use a weighted average grading scheme.
## Schedule

Use the utility `make_weeks.py` to generate a skeleton schedule. It will write the files `main.ptx` and `weekXX.ptx` with the boilerplate "Material" listed for each day the course meets.
